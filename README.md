# Gauss-Seidel-Elimination-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Gauss-Seidel Elimination method for solving systems of linear equations. The code reads coefficients from an Excel file (`data.xls`), performs Gauss-Seidel iteration with relaxation, and saves the results in a new Excel file. The method also includes error checking and verifies the results.
